# Student Portal Demo

This project is a simple student portal designed to help students and teachers manage academic information easily.

## What It Does
- Lets students keep their profiles up to date  
- Makes course registration straightforward  
- Shows grades clearly and accurately  
- Shares announcements and important updates  

## Why This Project Exists
I created this demo to explore how a basic student management system might work. It’s a starting point that can grow into something more useful over time.

## Built With
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or your preferred tools)  
- Git and GitHub for version control  

## What’s Next
Plans include adding user login, assignment tracking, and improving the design to make it more user-friendly.
This is just a foundation, ready to be built upon and tailored to specific needs.

This demo is a starting point for building a more full-featured student management system.
